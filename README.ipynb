    "1. We train AffordanceNet on [IIT-AFF dataset](https://sites.google.com/site/iitaffdataset/)\n",
    "\t- We need to format IIT-AFF dataset as in Pascal-VOC dataset for training.\n",
    "\t- For your convinience, we did it for you. Just download this file ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx3H_TbKFPCjV09MbkxGX0k1ZEU/view?usp=sharing), [One Drive](https://studenthcmusedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nqanh_mso_hcmus_edu_vn/EXQok71Y2kFAmhaabY2TQO8BFIO1AqqH5GcMOfPqgn_q2g?e=7rH3Kd)) and extract it into your `$AffordanceNet_ROOT` folder.\n",
    "\t- The extracted folder should contain three sub-folders: `$AffordanceNet_ROOT/data/cache`, `$AffordanceNet_ROOT/data/imagenet_models`, and `$AffordanceNet_ROOT/data/VOCdevkit2012` .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train AffordanceNet:\n",
    "\t- `cd $AffordanceNet_ROOT`\n",
    "\t- `./experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh [GPU_ID] [NET] [--set ...]`\n",
    "\t- e.g.: `./experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh 0 VGG16 pascal_voc`\n",
    "\t- We use `pascal_voc` alias although we're training using the IIT-AFF dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "1. AffordanceNet vs. Mask-RCNN: AffordanceNet can be considered as a general version of Mask-RCNN when we have multiple classes inside each instance.\n",
    "2. The current network achitecture is slightly diffrent from the paper, but it achieves the same accuracy.\n",
    "3. Train AffordanceNet on your data:\n",
    "\t- Format your images as in Pascal-VOC dataset (as in `$AffordanceNet_ROOT/data/VOCdevkit2012` folder).\n",
    "\t- Prepare the affordance masks (as in `$AffordanceNet_ROOT/data/cache` folder): For each object in the image, we need to create a mask and save as a .sm file. See `$AffordanceNet_ROOT/utils` for details.\n",
